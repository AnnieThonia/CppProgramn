Meeting goals and deadlines provides me a sense of achievement and allows me to look back and say, "I did that," which is why it motivates me. As it gives me a sense of purpose, achieving visible results, learning new things, coming up with innovative ideas to create or improve things, analysing complex data to reach simple and understandable conclusions, working well in a team, and finding a solution to a problem or challenge are also motivating factors for me.

Apart from the payslip, there are many other factors that can motivate people to do a good job, such as:
Sense of purpose: People often feel more motivated when they feel that their work is meaningful and contributes to a greater good.

Recognition and appreciation: When people feel that their hard work is noticed and appreciated, they are more likely to feel motivated to continue doing a good job.

Opportunities for growth and development: When people have opportunities to learn and grow in their roles, they are more likely to be motivated to do well.

Autonomy and control: When people have a degree of autonomy and control over their work, they are more likely to be motivated to do well.

Positive work environment: A positive work environment can also contribute to motivation. When people feel supported by their colleagues and management, and when there is a culture of respect and collaboration, they are more likely to be motivated to do their best.

Handling difficult situations with colleagues can be challenging, but there are a few things you can do to help manage the situation: "CLEmCMRs" 

Remain calm and composed: It's important to stay calm and composed when dealing with a difficult colleague. Avoid getting defensive or angry, and try to maintain a professional demeanor.

Listen actively: Try to listen actively to the other person's concerns and point of view. Show that you are taking their concerns seriously and are open to finding a resolution.

Be empathetic: Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to understand where they are coming from. Showing empathy can help to defuse tension and build rapport.

Communicate clearly and assertively: Clearly communicate your own concerns and point of view, but do so in a respectful and assertive manner. Be specific about the behavior or issue that is causing the difficulty, and focus on finding a constructive solution.

Seek a mediator: If you are unable to resolve the situation on your own, it may be helpful to seek the assistance of a mediator, such as a human resources representative or a supervisor.

Practice conflict resolution skills: You can improve your conflict resolution skills by practicing active listening, empathy, assertiveness, and problem-solving techniques. There are many resources available online or through professional development programs that can help you develop these skills.

In any difficult situation, I often  follow this rule of mine "CLEmCMRs" 
1. Stay Calm and compose
2. Listen Actively
3. Empathy
4. Communication
5. Seek a Mediator

During a difficult situation, I always try to maintain my cool by not being defensive /upset while listening actively to their own side of the story and finding ways to resolve the issue while communicating clearly and assertively. However, sometimes, when a colleague becomes very difficult and resolving the issue seems like a hard rock to climb, I tend to find a mediator( Most times my Line Manager) to help in resolving the issue.

By remaining calm, communicating clearly, and seeking a solution, you can help to maintain positive working relationships and a productive work environment.

I've learned a lot about your company and would be delighted to have the opportunity to work for a place that promotes employee professional and personal development and has a proven track record of high employee satisfaction. My recent Masters degree and previous employment have provided me with a great deal of training, but I still value furthering my education much. Another thing that is extremely important to me is working for a company that I can genuinely be proud of. Your positive online evaluations amply confirm that you are a well-known business with a substantial customer base.

In my most recent role as a BI/Data analyst in a Oil and Gas Sector, I expanded my expertise of SQL,database management and visualisation technologies. These skills allowed me analyse how successfully my many clients' businesses conformed with the Oil and Gas controlling body (NUPRC) regulations while handling data in conformance with the global data policy. I am convinced that as a data analyst, I can use these skills to help your business succeed in exceeding clients' expectations and the company's goals.

My golden guideline is to always look ahead. Do not proceed with it if it does not contribute to the success of the project or the firm as a whole. I do my best to keep my cool and communicate without bias, even when pressure is mounting.In retrospect, I took a step back and actively listened to my former coworker before laying out the facts and the reasons why we needed to work together effectively and offered options for how we might resolve any issues that had been hurting her. in the end, we were able to work together and finish the project on schedule.
